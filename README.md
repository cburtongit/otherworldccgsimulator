## Project Description
OtherWorld Competitive Card Game Simulator is a digital implementation of a card game I personally designed. Development will hit 3 major stages/releases:
### Solo-Concept (Alpha)
The aim here is to get all the potential player options working so that they can play with cards and test out the mechanics.
1. Part 1 - 1 Player demo that has no opponent and just allows the player to move cards around and perform actions.
2. Part 2 - 2 Player switch-user demo that allows 2 players on the same machine to play against each other - techincally playable but only for demo purposes
### Multiplayer-Manual (Beta - Usable!)
This adds multiplayer support and makes the first usable product. 2 players can connect to eachother (1 being the host) and play manually against eachother.
No card automation so unfit for competitive events without moderation but will be fine for casual users and testers!
### Multiplayer-Automatic (Release Version)
Full multiplayer support, with cards, effects and actions being automated. This can be by even new players that don't know how to play the game and for competitive events without game-to-game supervision, possibly with in-game tournament organisations by yours truly!
